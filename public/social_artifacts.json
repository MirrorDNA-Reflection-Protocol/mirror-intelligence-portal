As compute costs stabilize and consumer fatigue sets in, the major players (Apple, Google, OpenAI) are shifting focus to 'invisible intelligence'\u2014deep integration, battery efficiency, and institutional reliability. The noise has collapsed; the signal is operational depth.\n\nThree critical shifts observed today:\n\n1. OpenAI announces 'Sovereign-Lite' tiers for enterprise (local weights). \u2014 A direct response to Llama 4's dominance in on-prem markets.\n2. NVIDIA Blackwell yield issues resolved; stock up 4% pre-market. \u2014 Supply chain normalization faster than consensus.\n3. EU AI Act 'Phase 2' enforcement begins today. \u2014 General purpose models now require watermark compliance.\n\nMy take: The gap between signal and noise is widening. Only one of these actually changes the board state for next quarter.\n\nConstructive thoughts?\n\n#Strategy #AI #Leadership #MirrorIntelligence"
