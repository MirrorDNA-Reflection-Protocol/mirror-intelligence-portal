This enables them to hide from or deceive both predators and prey. Most studies have focused on benthic species of octopus and cuttlefish, while studies on squid focused mainly on the chromatophore system for communication. Camouflage adaptations to the substrate while moving has been recently described in the semi-pelagic oval squid (<i>Sepioteuthis lessoniana</i>). Our current study focuses on the same squid&#8217;s complex camouflage to substrate in a stationary, motionless position. We observed disruptive, uniform, and mottled chromatic body patterns, and we identified a threshold of contrast between dark and light chromatic components that simplifies the identification of disruptive chromatic body pattern. We found that arm postural components are related to the squid position in the environment, either sitting directly on the substrate or hovering just few centimeters above the substrate. Several of these context-dependent body patterns have not yet been observed in ...</p></blockquote>",

We watched Condor cameras zoom in on a woman walking her dog on a bike path in suburban Atlanta; a camera followed a man walking through a Macy&#8217;s parking lot in Bakersfield; surveil children swinging on a swingset at a playground; and film high-res video of people sitting at a stoplight in traffic. In one case, we were able to watch a man rollerblade down Brookhaven, Georgia&#8217;s Peachtree Creek Greenway bike path. The Flock camera zoomed in on him and tracked him as he rolled past. Minutes later, he showed up on another exposed camera livestream further down the bike path.

                "text": "<p>When the creator of the world&#x27;s most advanced coding agent speaks, Silicon Valley doesn&#x27;t just listen \u2014 it takes notes.</p><p>For the past week, the engineering community has been dissecting a <a href=\"https://x.com/bcherny/status/2007179832300581177\">thread on X</a> from <a href=\"https://x.com/bcherny\">Boris Cherny</a>, the creator and head of <a href=\"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview\">Claude Code</a> at <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/\">Anthropic</a>. What began as a casual sharing of his personal terminal setup has spiraled into a viral manifesto on the future of software development, with industry insiders calling it a watershed moment for the startup.</p><div></div><p>&quot;If you&#x27;re not reading the Claude Code best practices straight from its creator, you&#x27;re behind as a programmer,&quot; wrote <a href=\"https://x.com/jefftangx\">Jeff Tang</a>, a prominent voice in the developer community. <a href=\"https://x.com/KyleMcnease/status/2007555584724480338\">Kyle McNease</a>, another industry observer, went further, declaring that with Cherny&#x27;s &quot;game-changing updates,&quot; Anthropic is &quot;on fire,&quot; potentially facing &quot;their ChatGPT moment.&quot;</p><p>The excitement stems from a paradox: Cherny&#x27;s workflow is surprisingly simple, yet it allows a single human to operate with the output capacity of a small engineering department. As one user noted on X after implementing Cherny&#x27;s setup, the experience &quot;<a href=\"https://x.com/mtwichan\">feels more like Starcraft</a>&quot; than traditional coding \u2014 a shift from typing syntax to commanding autonomous units.</p><p>Here is an analysis of the workflow that is reshaping how software gets built, straight from the architect himself. </p><h2><b>How running five AI agents at once turns coding into a real-time strategy game</b></h2><p>The most striking revelation from Cherny&#x27;s disclosure is that he does not code in a linear fashion. In the traditional &quot;<a href=\"https://notes.paulswail.com/public/The+inner+and+outer+loops+of+software+development+workflow\">inner loop</a>&quot; of development, a programmer writes a function, tests it, and moves to the next. Cherny, however, acts as a fleet commander.</p><p>&quot;I run 5 Claudes in parallel in my terminal,&quot; Cherny wrote. &quot;I number my tabs 1-5, and use system notifications to know when a Claude needs input.&quot;</p><p>By utilizing iTerm2 system notifications, Cherny effectively manages five simultaneous work streams. While one agent runs a test suite, another refactors a legacy module, and a third drafts documentation. He also runs &quot;5-10 Claudes on <a href=\"https://claude.ai/\">claude.ai</a>&quot; in his browser, using a &quot;teleport&quot; command to hand off sessions between the web and his local machine.</p><p>This validates the &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/03/anthropic-daniela-amodei-do-more-with-less-bet.html\">do more with less</a>&quot; strategy articulated by Anthropic President Daniela Amodei earlier this week. While competitors like OpenAI pursue trillion-dollar infrastructure build-outs, Anthropic is proving that superior orchestration of existing models can yield exponential productivity gains.</p><h2><b>The counterintuitive case for choosing the slowest, smartest model</b></h2><p>In a surprising move for an industry obsessed with latency, Cherny revealed that he exclusively uses Anthropic&#x27;s heaviest, slowest model: <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5\">Opus 4.5</a>.</p><p>&quot;I use Opus 4.5 with thinking for everything,&quot; Cherny <a href=\"https://x.com/bcherny/status/2007179838864666847\">explained</a>. &quot;It&#x27;s the best coding model I&#x27;ve ever used, and even though it&#x27;s bigger &amp; slower than Sonnet, since you have to steer it less and it&#x27;s better at tool use, it is almost always faster than using a smaller model in the end.&quot;</p><p>For enterprise technology leaders, this is a critical insight. The bottleneck in modern AI development isn&#x27;t the generation speed of the token; it is the human time spent correcting the AI&#x27;s mistakes. Cherny&#x27;s workflow suggests that paying the &quot;compute tax&quot; for a smarter model upfront eliminates the &quot;correction tax&quot; later.</p><h2><b>One shared file turns every AI mistake into a permanent lesson</b></h2><p>Cherny also detailed how his team solves the problem of AI amnesia. Standard large language models do not &quot;remember&quot; a company&#x27;s specific coding style or architectural decisions from one session to the next.</p><p>To address this, Cherny&#x27;s team maintains a single file named <a href=\"https://x.com/bcherny/status/2007179842928947333\">CLAUDE.md</a> in their git repository. &quot;Anytime we see Claude do something incorrectly we add it to the CLAUDE.md, so Claude knows not to do it next time,&quot; he wrote.</p><p>This practice transforms the codebase into a self-correcting organism. When a human developer reviews a pull request and spots an error, they don&#x27;t just fix the code; they tag the AI to update its own instructions. &quot;<a href=\"https://x.com/aakashgupta/status/2007347705945944153\">Every mistake becomes a rule</a>,&quot; noted <a href=\"https://x.com/aakashgupta\">Aakash Gupta</a>, a product leader analyzing the thread. The longer the team works together, the smarter the agent becomes.</p><h2><b>Slash commands and subagents automate the most tedious parts of development</b></h2><p>The &quot;vanilla&quot; workflow one observer praised is powered by rigorous automation of repetitive tasks. Cherny uses slash commands \u2014 custom shortcuts checked into the project&#x27;s repository \u2014 to handle complex operations with a single keystroke.</p><p>He highlighted a command called <i><b>/commit-push-pr</b></i>, which he invokes dozens of times daily. Instead of manually typing git commands, writing a commit message, and opening a pull request, the agent handles the bureaucracy of version control autonomously.</p><p>Cherny also deploys subagents \u2014 specialized AI personas \u2014 to handle specific phases of the development lifecycle. He uses a code-simplifier to clean up architecture after the main work is done and a verify-app agent to run end-to-end tests before anything ships.</p><h2><b>Why verification loops are the real unlock for AI-generated code</b></h2><p>If there is a single reason Claude Code has reportedly hit <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-acquires-bun-as-claude-code-reaches-usd1b-milestone\">$1 billion in annual recurring revenue</a> so quickly, it is likely the verification loop. The AI is not just a text generator; it is a tester.</p><p>&quot;Claude tests every single change I land to claude.ai/code using the Claude Chrome extension,&quot; Cherny wrote. &quot;It opens a browser, tests the UI, and iterates until the code works and the UX feels good.&quot;</p><p>He argues that giving the AI a way to verify its own work \u2014 whether through browser automation, running bash commands, or executing test suites \u2014 improves the quality of the final result by &quot;2-3x.&quot; The agent doesn&#x27;t just write code; it proves the code works.</p><h2><b>What Cherny&#x27;s workflow signals about the future of software engineering</b></h2><p>The reaction to Cherny&#x27;s thread suggests a pivotal shift in how developers think about their craft. For years, &quot;AI coding&quot; meant an autocomplete function in a text editor \u2014 a faster way to type. Cherny has demonstrated that it can now function as an operating system for labor itself.</p><p>&quot;Read this if you&#x27;re already an engineer... and want more power,&quot; <a href=\"https://x.com/jefftangx/status/2008246873275215890\">Jeff Tang</a> summarized on X.</p><p>The tools to multiply human output by a factor of five are already here. They require only a willingness to stop thinking of AI as an assistant and start treating it as a workforce. The programmers who make that mental leap first won&#x27;t just be more productive. They&#x27;ll be playing an entirely different game \u2014 and everyone else will still be typing.</p>",

Instead of relying on a central coordinator or rigid workflows, Brex has built what it calls an \u201cAgent Mesh\u201d: a network of narrow, role-specific agents that communicate in plain language and operate independently \u2014 but with full visibility.</p><p>\u201cOur goal is to use AI to make Brex effectively disappear,\u201d Reggio told VentureBeat. \u201cWe\u2019re aiming for total automation.\u201d</p><p>Brex learned that for its purposes, agents need to work in narrow, specific roles to be more modular, flexible, and auditable.\u00a0</p><p>Reggio said the architectural goal is to enable every manager in an enterprise \u201cto have a single point of contact within Brex that\u2019s handling the totality of their responsibilities, be it spend management, requesting travel, or approving spend limit requests.\u201d</p><h2>The journey from Brex Assistant</h2><p>The financial services industry has long embraced AI and machine learning to handle the massive amounts of data it processes. But when it comes to bringing AI models and agents, the <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/gen-ai-takes-over-finance-the-leading-applications-and-their-challenges\"><u>industry took a more cautious road</u></a> at the beginning. Now, more financial services companies, including Brex, have <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/orchestration/jp-morgans-ai-adoption-hit-50-of-employees-the-secret-a-connectivity-first\"><u>launched AI-powered platforms</u></a> and <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-big-u-s-bank-bny-manages-armies-of-ai-agents\"><u>several agentic workflows</u></a>.\u00a0</p><p>Brex\u2019s first foray into generative AI was with its Brex Assistant, released in 2023, which helped customers automate certain finance and expense tasks. It provides suggestions to complete expenses, automatically fills in information, and follows up on expenses that violate policies.\u00a0</p><p>Reggio acknowledges that Brex Assistant works, but it\u2019s not enough.\u00a0 \u201cI think to some degree, it remains a bit of a technology where we don&#x27;t entirely know the limits of it,&quot; he said. &quot;There&#x27;s quite a large number of patterns that need to exist around it that are kind of being developed by the industry as the technology matures and as more companies build with it.&quot;\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Brex Assistant uses multiple models, including <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/anthropics-claude-code-helped-brex-write-80-new-codebase\">Anthropic\u2019s Claude</a> and custom Brex-models, as well as OpenAI\u2019s API. The assistant automates some tasks but is still limited in how low-touch it can be.\u00a0</p><p>Reggio said Brex Assistant still plays a big role in the company\u2019s autonomy journey, mainly because its Agent Mesh product flows into the application.\u00a0</p><h2>A<!-- -->gent Mesh to replace orchestration</h2><p>The consensus in the industry is that multi-agent ecosystems, in which agents communicate to accomplish tasks, require an orchestration framework to guide them.\u00a0</p><p>Reggio, on the other hand, has a different take.\u00a0&quot;Deterministic orchestration infrastructure \u2026 was a solution for the problems that we saw two years ago, which was that agents, just like the models, hallucinate a lot,\u201d Reggio said. \u201cThey&#x27;re not very good with multiple tools, so you need to give them these degrees of freedom, but in a more structured, rigid system. But as the models get better, I think it&#x27;s starting to hold back the range of possibilities that are expanding.\u201d</p><p>More traditional agent orchestration architectures either focus on a single agent that does everything or, more commonly, coordinator/orchestrator plus tool agents  that explicitly define workflows. Reggio said both frameworks are too rigid and solve issues more commonly seen in traditional software than in AI.\u00a0</p><p>The difference, Reggio argues, is structural:</p><ul><li><p><b>Traditional orchestration</b>: predefined workflows, central coordinator, deterministic paths</p></li><li><p><b>Agent Mesh</b>: event-driven, role-specialized agents, message-based coordination</p></li></ul><p>Agent Mesh relies on stitching together networks of many small agents, each specializing in a single task. The agents, once again using the hybrid mix of models as with the Brex Assistant, communicate with other agents \u201cin plain English\u201d over a shared message stream. A routing model quickly determines which tools to invoke, he said.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>A single reimbursement request triggers several tasks: a compliance check to align with expense policies, budget validation, receipt matching, and then payment initiation. While an agent can certainly be coded to do all of that, this method is \u201cbrittle and error-prone,\u201d and it responds to new information shared through a message stream anyway.\u00a0</p><p>Reggio said the idea is to disambiguate all of those separate tasks and assign them to smaller agents instead. He likened the architecture to a Wi-Fi mesh, where no single node controls the system \u2014 reliability emerges from many small, overlapping contributors.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe basically found a really good fit with the idea of embodying specific roles as agents on top of the best platform to manage specific responsibilities, much like how you might delegate accounts payable to one team versus expense management to another team,\u201d Reggio said. </p><p>Brex defines three core ideas in the Agent Mesh architecture:</p><ul><li><p>Config, where definitions of the agent, model, tools and subscription live</p></li><li><p>MessageStream, a log of every message, tool call and state transition\u00a0</p></li><li><p>Clock, which ensures deterministic ordering\u00a0</p></li></ul><p>Brex also built evaluations into the system, in which the LLM acts as a judge, and an audit agent reviews each agent\u2019s decisions to ensure they adhere to accuracy and behavioral policies.\u00a0</p><h2>Success so far</h2><p>Brex says it has seen substantial efficiency gains among its customers in its AI ecosystem. Brex did not provide third-party benchmarks or customer-specific data to validate those gains.</p><p>But Reggio said enterprise customers using Brex Assistant and the company\u2019s machine learning systems \u201care able to achieve 99% automation, especially for customers that really leaned into AI.\u201d</p><p>This is a marked improvement from the 60 to 70% Brex customers who were able to automate their expense processes before the launch of Brex Assistant.\u00a0</p><p>The company is still early in its autonomy journey, Reggio said. But if the Agent Mesh approach works, the most successful outcome may be invisible: employees no longer thinking about expenses at all.</p>",

                "text": "<p>For the last two years, the prevailing logic in generative AI has been one of brute force: if you want better reasoning, you need a bigger model. </p><p>While &quot;small&quot; models (under 10 billion parameters) have become capable conversationalists, they have historically crumbled when asked to perform multi-step logical deduction or complex mathematical proofs.</p><p>Today, the Technology Innovation Institute (TII) in Abu Dhabi is challenging that scaling law with<a href=\"https://falcon-lm.github.io/blog/falcon-h1r-7b/\"> the release of Falcon H1R 7B</a>. </p><p>By abandoning the pure Transformer orthodoxy in favor of a hybrid architecture, TII claims to have built a 7-billion parameter model that not only rivals but outperforms competitors nearly 7X its size \u2014 including the 32B and 47B variants of Alibaba&#x27;s Qwen and Nvidia&#x27;s Nemotron.</p><p>The release marks a significant shift in the open-weight ecosystem, moving the battleground from raw parameter count to architectural efficiency and inference-time scaling.</p><p>The full <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/Falcon-H1R-7B\">model code is available now at Hugging Face</a> and can be tested by individuals in a live demo inference on <a href=\"chat.falconllm.tii.ae\">Falcon Chat </a>(a chatbot experience). TII further released a seemingly quite comprehensive <a href=\"https://github.com/tiiuae/falcon-h1r/blob/main/tech_report.pdf\">technical report</a> on the approach and training methodology for Falcon H1 7B, as well. </p><h2>Moving Beyond the Foundational LLM Tech, the Transformer</h2><p>The defining feature of Falcon H1R 7B is its &quot;hybrid&quot; backbone. Most modern LLMs rely exclusively on the Transformer architecture, which scales predictably but suffers from high memory costs when processing long sequences. </p><p>Falcon H1R 7B integrates Mamba, a state-space model (SSM) architecture, alongside standard Transformer attention layers.</p><p>Originally developed by researchers Albert Gu and Tri Dao at Carnegie Mellon University and Princeton University, Mamba was first introduced in the paper &quot;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752\">Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces</a>&quot; published on December 1, 2023.</p><p>The architecture processes data sequences differently than Transformers: while Transformers compare every piece of data to every other piece (quadratic scaling), Mamba processes tokens sequentially, allowing it to handle vast amounts of information with linear scaling and significantly reduced compute costs.</p><p>This combination addresses one of the most persistent bottlenecks in deploying reasoning models: the cost of &quot;thinking.&quot; Reasoning models require generating long &quot;chains of thought&quot;\u2014step-by-step internal monologues\u2014before arriving at an answer. For standard Transformers, these long contexts explode computational costs.</p><p>According to TII\u2019s technical report, the hybrid approach allows Falcon H1R 7B to maintain high throughput even as response lengths grow. At a batch size of 64, the model processes approximately 1,500 tokens per second per GPU\u2014nearly double the speed of the competing Qwen3 8B model.</p><h2>Benchmark Performance: Punching Up</h2><p>In the benchmarks released by TII, the disparity between Falcon H1R 7B\u2019s size and its performance is stark. On the <b>AIME 2025</b> leaderboard\u2014a rigorous test of mathematical reasoning\u2014Falcon H1R 7B scored <b>83.1%</b>, a result that disrupts the traditional hierarchy of model sizing.</p><p>While the 7B model naturally trails massive proprietary frontiers like <b>GPT-5.2</b> (99.0%) and <b>Gemini 3 Flash</b> (97.0%) on the <a href=\"https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/aime-2025\">separate Artificial Analysis index</a> (run by the independent organization of the same name, which has not yet benchmarked Falcon H1R 7B yet), it has effectively collapsed the gap between &quot;efficient&quot; open weights and mid-tier proprietary systems.</p><ul><li><p><b>Beating Larger &quot;Thinkers&quot;:</b> Falcon H1R 7B (83.1%) outperforms the 15-billion parameter <b>Apriel-v1.6-Thinker</b> (82.7%) and the 32-billion parameter <b>OLMo 3 Think</b> (73.7%), validating TII&#x27;s claim that hybrid architectures can out-reason larger Transformers.</p></li><li><p><b>Chasing Proprietary Leaders:</b> It sits within striking distance of <b>Claude 4.5 Sonnet</b> (88.0%) and <b>Amazon Nova 2.0 Lite</b> (88.7%), suggesting that for specific math-heavy workflows, this 7B model is a viable, low-latency alternative to expensive commercial APIs.</p></li><li><p><b>Outperforming Legacy Giants:</b> On this specific reasoning metric, it decisively beats broadly capable but older architectures like <b>Mistral Large 3</b> (38.0%) and <b>Llama 4 Maverick</b> (19.3%), highlighting how specialized reasoning training (&quot;Deep Think&quot;) has become more critical than raw scale for logic tasks.</p></li></ul><p>Other key domain wins include:</p><ul><li><p><b>Coding:</b> The model achieved <b>68.6%</b> on the LCB v6 benchmark, a score TII claims is the highest among all tested models, including those four times its size.</p></li><li><p><b>General Reasoning:</b> While it dominates in math and code, its general reasoning score (49.48%) remains competitive, sitting just below the 14B and 15B parameter models but comfortably ahead of comparable 8B models.</p></li></ul><h2>Training Techniques</h2><p>Falcon H1R 7B\u2019s performance is not just architectural; it stems from a rigorous, two-stage training pipeline designed to maximize reasoning density without inflating parameter count, according to <a href=\"https://github.com/tiiuae/falcon-h1r/blob/main/tech_report.pdf\">TII&#x27;s technical report</a> on the model.</p><p><b>Stage 1: </b>Cold-Start Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). The model underwent &quot;cold-start&quot; SFT on a curated dataset dominated by mathematics (56.8% of tokens) and code (29.8%), with response lengths stretching up to 48,000 tokens.</p><ul><li><p><b>Difficulty-Aware Weighting:</b> TII rejected the standard practice of treating all data equally. Instead, they applied a weighting scheme where &quot;hard&quot; problems were up-weighted by 1.25x to 1.75x, while easy problems were down-weighted or removed entirely to prevent overfitting to trivial tasks.</p></li><li><p><b>Single-Teacher Consistency: </b>Ablation studies revealed that mixing reasoning traces from multiple &quot;teacher&quot; models actually degraded performance due to conflicting reasoning styles. Consequently, TII opted for a single-teacher approach to maintain coherent internal logic.</p></li><li><p><b>Balanced Token Normalization: </b>To handle the massive variance in sequence lengths (short instructions vs. massive reasoning chains), the team introduced a Balanced Data-Parallel Token Normalization strategy. This technique equalizes the gradient contribution of each token across GPUs, preventing ranks with shorter sequences from destabilizing the loss\u2014a change that yielded a consistent 4-10% accuracy boost during training.</p></li></ul><p><b>Stage 2:</b> Reinforcement Learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Following SFT, the model was refined using GRPO a reinforcement learning algorithm that rewards correct outcomes without needing a separate value model.</p><ul><li><p><b>The &quot;No-KL&quot; Shift:</b> In a deviation from standard RLHF, TII removed the KL-divergence penalty (beta=0) entirely. This allowed the model to drift significantly from its base SFT policy, encouraging aggressive exploration of novel reasoning paths.</p></li><li><p><b>Math-Only Curriculum: </b>Surprisingly, TII found that training exclusively on math problems during the RL stage yielded better generalization across all domains\u2014including code and science\u2014than mixed strategies. Ablations showed that &quot;code-only&quot; training improved coding scores but harmed general reasoning, whereas math-focused RL lifted performance globally.</p></li></ul><p>TII optimized the model specifically for Test-Time Scaling (TTS), a technique where a model generates multiple reasoning paths in parallel to find the best solution.</p><p>The model utilizes Deep Think with Confidence (DeepConf), which leverages the model&#x27;s internal confidence scores to dynamically prune low-quality reasoning traces.</p><ul><li><p><b>Adaptive Pruning:</b> During generation, the system initiates a &quot;warm-up&quot; phase with 16 traces to establish a confidence baseline. It then aggressively filters subsequent traces, terminating any chain that falls below the 10th percentile of the baseline confidence.</p></li><li><p><b>Efficiency Gains:</b> This method creates a new Pareto frontier for deployment. In benchmark tests, Falcon H1R 7B achieved 96.7% accuracy on AIME 25 while reducing token usage by 38% compared to the DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B baseline.</p></li></ul><h2>Licensing: Open For Commercial Usage, But With Strings Attached</h2><p>TII has released Falcon H1R 7B under the custom <b>Falcon LLM License 1.0</b> based on Apache 2.0 \u2014 but with notable modifications \u2014 chiefly among them: not to litigate against TII, and also to always credit it.</p><p>For developers and startups, the license is largely permissive:</p><ul><li><p><b>Royalty-Free:</b> Users can run, modify, and distribute the model commercially without paying TII.</p></li><li><p><b>Attribution:</b> Any derivative work (including fine-tunes) must prominently state: <i>&quot;[Name of work] is built using Falcon LLM technology from the Technology Innovation Institute&quot;</i>.</p></li></ul><p>However, unlike a pure Open Source Initiative (OSI) license, the Falcon license includes a strict Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). </p><p>The license terminates automatically if the model is used to create work that conflicts with the AUP or if the user initiates patent litigation against TII. </p><p>Specifically, the AUP prohibits using Falcon H1R 7B or its derivatives for:</p><ul><li><p>Violating Laws: Any use that violates applicable national, federal, state, local, or international laws or regulations.</p></li><li><p>Harm to Minors or Living Beings: Exploiting, harming, or attempting to exploit or harm minors or any living beings.</p></li><li><p>Disinformation: Generating or disseminating verifiably false information with the purpose of harming others.</p></li><li><p>Harassment: Defaming, disparaging, or otherwise harassing others.</p></li></ul><h2>The Hybrid Wave: Nvidia, IBM, AI21, and Mistral</h2><p>TII is not alone in betting on this hybrid future; the industry is increasingly moving toward architectures that blend the strengths of SSMs and Transformers.</p><ul><li><p><b>Nvidia</b> recently debuted the <a href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-debuts-nemotron-3-family-of-open-models\">Nemotron 3 family</a> on December 15, 2025, which utilizes a hybrid mixture-of-experts (MoE) and Mamba-Transformer design to drive efficient agentic AI.</p></li><li><p><b>IBM</b> launched its <a href=\"https://newsroom.ibm.com/campaign?item=2416\">Granite 4.0 family</a> on October 2, 2025, using a hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture to cut memory requirements by over 70% while maintaining high performance on enterprise benchmarks.</p></li><li><p><b>AI21</b> has pursued this path with its Jamba (Joint Attention and Mamba) models, releasing the <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/jamba-1-5-model-family-from-ai21-labs-is-now-available-on-vertex-ai\">Jamba 1.5 family</a> on August 22, 2024, to boost agentic AI capabilities through a hybrid SSM-Transformer approach.</p></li><li><p><b>Mistral</b> entered the space early with <a href=\"https://mistral.ai/news/codestral-mamba/\">Codestral Mamba</a> on July 16, 2024, a model specifically optimized for faster, longer code generation.</p></li></ul><p>Falcon H1R 7B represents the latest evolution in this trend, specifically targeting dense reasoning tasks in a compact form factor.</p>",

                "text": "<p>A new study from researchers at Stanford University and Nvidia proposes a way for AI models to keep learning after deployment \u2014 without increasing inference costs. For enterprise agents that have to digest long docs, tickets, and logs, this is a bid to get \u201clong memory\u201d without paying attention costs that grow with context length.</p><p>The approach, called \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23675\"><u>End-to-End Test-Time Training</u></a>\u201d (TTT-E2E), reframes language modeling as a continual learning problem: Instead of memorizing facts during pre-training, models learn how to adapt in real time as they process new information.</p><p>The result is a Transformer that can match long-context accuracy of full attention models while running at near-RNN efficiency \u2014 a potential breakthrough for enterprise workloads where context length is colliding with cost.</p><h2>The accuracy-efficiency trade-off</h2><p>For developers building AI systems for long-document tasks, the choice of model architecture often involves a painful trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.</p><p>On one side are Transformers with full self-attention, currently the gold standard for accuracy. They are designed to scan through the keys and values of all previous tokens for every new token generated, providing them with lossless recall. However, this precision comes at a steep cost: The computational cost per token grows significantly with context length. </p><p>On the other side are linear-time sequence models, which keep inference costs constant but struggle to retain information over very long contexts. </p><p>Other approaches try to split the difference \u2014 sliding-window attention, hybrids that mix attention with recurrence, and other efficiency tricks \u2014 but they still tend to fall short of full attention on hard language modeling.</p><p>The researchers\u2019 bet is that the missing ingredient is compression: Instead of trying to recall every token exactly, models should distill what matters into a compact state.</p><h2>Test-Time Training</h2><p>The core innovation of the paper is the application of Test-Time Training (TTT) to language modeling. This transforms the model from a static database into a flexible learner.</p><p>In standard AI deployment, models are trained to minimize loss and then deployed as frozen artifacts. If you try to make a static model learn during deployment, it typically performs poorly because it was never trained to update itself efficiently.</p><p>The researchers solve this by shifting from standard pre-training (teaching the model facts) to meta-learning (teaching the model how to learn). The goal is to optimize the model\u2019s &quot;initialization&quot; so that it can absorb new information rapidly when it goes live. </p><p>The process involves simulating inference-time learning during the training phase:</p><ul><li><p><b>Inner loop (learn): </b>During training, the model treats text as a stream and performs small, temporary updates as it predicts the next token \u2014 simulating how it would adapt at inference.</p></li><li><p><b>Outer loop (teach it to learn)</b>: The system then updates the model\u2019s initialization so the next round of streaming adaptation becomes faster and more accurate.</p></li></ul><p>While the idea of a model changing its weights during deployment might sound risky to reliability focused enterprise leaders, co-author Yu Sun argues it is mathematically safer than it appears.</p><p>\u201cYou should think of the model as an RNN with a huge hidden state,\u201d Sun says. He notes that if an enterprise feels safe deploying standard Transformers or RNNs, the stability profile of TTT is comparable.</p><h2>Dual-memory architecture</h2><p>To implement TTT-E2E, the researchers modified the standard Transformer architecture to support this new learning paradigm, creating a hierarchy that separates cheap short-term context handling from selective long-term memory updates.</p><ol><li><p><b>T</b><b>he model uses Sliding Window Attention rather than full attention. </b>This acts as the model&#x27;s &quot;working memory,&quot; looking back only at a fixed window of recent tokens to handle immediate syntax and local references. This ensures the cost of processing a new token remains constant rather than growing as the context expands.</p></li><li><p><b>The model employs \u201ctargeted weight updates.\u201d</b> While standard models have completely frozen weights during use, TTT-E2E designates specific sections (Multi-Layer Perceptron layers in the final 25% of the model&#x27;s blocks) to be mutable.</p></li><li><p><b>The architecture uses a \u201cdual-track storage\u201d to prevent the model from forgetting</b> its general training while learning a new document. Each updateable block contains two MLP components: one static layer that holds general pre-trained knowledge, and one dynamic layer that updates in real-time to store the current document&#x27;s context.</p></li></ol><p>The innovation lies in how the model handles information that falls out of the sliding window. In a standard sliding window model, once a token slides out of view, it is forgotten. TTT-E2E prevents this via compression. As the window moves, the model uses next-token prediction to &quot;compress&quot; the passing information directly into the weights of the dynamic MLP layers. This consolidates the gist and facts of the earlier parts of the document into the model&#x27;s structure, serving as a long-term memory.</p><h2>TTT-E2E in action</h2><p>The headline result: TTT-E2E continues improving as context length grows \u2014 matching or outperforming full attention \u2014 while efficient baselines plateau after ~32,000 tokens.</p><p>To validate their approach, the researchers trained models ranging from 125 million to 3 billion parameters. They employed a two-stage training process: pre-training on 8,000-token contexts and fine-tuning on 128,000-token contexts. These models were tested against robust baselines, including Transformers with full attention, Transformers with Sliding Window Attention (SWA), hybrid models (Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet), and TTT-KVB (an earlier form of test-time training).</p><p>The results highlight a significant breakthrough in scaling. The most critical experiment tested performance as the input document grew from 8,000 to 128,000 tokens. The Full Attention Transformer, the gold standard, continued to improve its performance (lower loss) as the context grew. In contrast, efficient baselines like Mamba 2, Gated DeltaNet, and SWA hit a ceiling, with their performance degrading or flattening out after 32,000 tokens.</p><p>The new TTT-E2E method successfully scaled with context length, mimicking the behavior of Full Attention. In the experiments using 3B parameter models, TTT-E2E actually maintained a lower perplexity (better performance) than Full Attention throughout the context window.</p><p>Critically, this performance did not come at the cost of speed. On inference latency, TTT-E2E matched the efficiency of RNNs. At a context length of 128k tokens, TTT-E2E was 2.7x faster than the Full-Attention Transformer on Nvidia H100 hardware.</p><p>Crucially for adoption, Sun notes that TTT models can be deployed for inference today on standard Transformer infrastructure to achieve these speedups. However, he cautions that the training side of the equation (specifically the outer loop) is currently more complex and slower than standard methods, representing a hurdle that still needs engineering optimization.</p><p>The benefits become even more drastic as data scales. Sun argues the advantage should widen further at million-token contexts, though those figures are projections rather than today\u2019s benchmarked deployments.</p><p>However, the approach does have specific limitations rooted in its design philosophy. The researchers performed a &quot;Needle in a Haystack&quot; test, which requires the model to retrieve a specific, isolated piece of information (like a passcode) hidden in a large block of text. In this evaluation, Full Attention dramatically outperformed all other methods, including TTT-E2E.</p><p>This is because Full Attention relies on a cache that allows for nearly lossless recall of specific details, whereas TTT-E2E relies on compression. Compression captures the intuition and core information perfectly but may lose specific, random details that do not fit the learned patterns.</p><p>This distinction has major implications for enterprise data pipelines, specifically RAG. Sun suggests that TTT won&#x27;t make RAG obsolete but will redefine it. He likens TTT to &quot;updating the human brain&quot; with general knowledge, while RAG will remain a necessary tool for precision, &quot;similar to how humans still need to write things down in a notepad.&quot; For enterprise teams, the takeaway is that TTT reduces how often you need retrieval \u2014 but doesn\u2019t eliminate the need for exact external memory.</p><p>While the technique was demonstrated on the Transformer architecture, the researchers note that \u201cin principle, TTT can be applied to any baseline architecture\u201d that allows for a separation of long-term and short-term memory components.</p><p>\u201cWe believe that these two classes of memory will continue to complement each other,&quot; the researchers concluded.\u00a0</p><p>Looking ahead, Sun predicts a paradigm shift where the primary form of AI memory will be highly compressed rather than exact.

                "text": "<p>The arms race to build smarter AI models has a measurement problem: the tests used to rank them are becoming obsolete almost as quickly as the models improve. On Monday, <a href=\"https://artificialanalysis.ai/\">Artificial Analysis</a>, an independent AI benchmarking organization whose rankings are closely watched by developers and enterprise buyers, released a major overhaul to its <a href=\"https://artificialanalysis.ai/?intelligence=agentic-index\">Intelligence Index</a> that fundamentally changes how the industry measures AI progress.</p><p>The new <a href=\"https://artificialanalysis.ai/methodology/intelligence-benchmarking\">Intelligence Index v4.0</a> incorporates 10 evaluations spanning agents, coding, scientific reasoning, and general knowledge. But the changes go far deeper than shuffling test names. The organization removed three staple benchmarks \u2014 <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/TIGER-Lab/MMLU-Pro\">MMLU-Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/aime-2025\">AIME 2025</a>, and <a href=\"https://livecodebench.github.io/\">LiveCodeBench</a> \u2014 that have long been cited by AI companies in their marketing materials. In their place, the new index introduces evaluations designed to measure whether AI systems can complete the kind of work that people actually get paid to do.</p><p><span>type: <!-- -->embedded-entry-inline<!-- --> id: <!-- -->1bCmRrroGCdUb07IuaHysL</span></p><p>&quot;This index shift reflects a broader transition: intelligence is being measured less by recall and more by economically useful action,&quot; observed <a href=\"https://x.com/aravind3sundar/status/2008590426622795848\">Aravind Sundar</a>, a researcher who responded to the announcement on X (formerly Twitter).</p><h2><b>Why AI benchmarks are breaking: The problem with tests that top models have already mastered</b></h2><p>The benchmark overhaul addresses a growing crisis in AI evaluation: the leading models have become so capable that traditional tests can no longer meaningfully differentiate between them. The new index deliberately makes the curve harder to climb. According to <a href=\"https://artificialanalysis.ai/methodology\">Artificial Analysis</a>, top models now score 50 or below on the new v4.0 scale, compared to 73 on the previous version \u2014 a recalibration designed to restore headroom for future improvement.</p><p>This saturation problem has plagued the industry for months. When every frontier model scores in the 90th percentile on a given test, the test loses its usefulness as a decision-making tool for enterprises trying to choose which AI system to deploy. The new methodology attempts to solve this by weighting four categories equally \u2014 Agents, Coding, Scientific Reasoning, and Genera l\u2014 while introducing evaluations where even the most advanced systems still struggle.</p><p>The results under the new framework show OpenAI&#x27;s <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-2/\">GPT-5.2</a> with extended reasoning effort claiming the top spot, followed closely by Anthropic&#x27;s <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5\">Claude Opus 4.5</a> and Google&#x27;s <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/pro/\">Gemini 3 Pro</a>. OpenAI describes GPT-5.2 as &quot;the most capable model series yet for professional knowledge work,&quot; while Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Opus 4.5 scores higher than GPT-5.2 on <a href=\"https://www.swebench.com/\">SWE-Bench Verified</a>, a test set evaluating software coding abilities.</p><h2><b>GDPval-AA: The new benchmark testing whether AI can do your job</b></h2><p>The most significant addition to the new index is <a href=\"https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/gdpval-aa\">GDPval-AA</a>, an evaluation based on OpenAI&#x27;s <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/gdpval/\">GDPval dataset</a> that tests AI models on real-world economically valuable tasks across 44 occupations and 9 major industries. Unlike traditional benchmarks that ask models to solve abstract math problems or answer multiple-choice trivia, GDPval-AA measures whether AI can produce the deliverables that professionals actually create: documents, slides, diagrams, spreadsheets, and multimedia content.</p><p>Models receive shell access and web browsing capabilities through what Artificial Analysis calls &quot;Stirrup,&quot; its reference agentic harness. Scores are derived from blind pairwise comparisons, with ELO ratings frozen at the time of evaluation to ensure index stability.</p><p>Under this framework, OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-5.2 with extended reasoning leads with an ELO score of 1442, while Anthropic&#x27;s Claude Opus 4.5 non-thinking variant follows at 1403. Claude Sonnet 4.5 trails at 1259.</p><p>On the original GDPval evaluation, GPT-5.2 beat or tied top industry professionals on 70.9% of well-specified tasks, according to OpenAI. The company <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-2/\">claims</a> GPT-5.2 &quot;outperforms industry professionals at well-specified knowledge work tasks spanning 44 occupations,&quot; with companies including Notion, Box, Shopify, Harvey, and Zoom observing &quot;state-of-the-art long-horizon reasoning and tool-calling performance.&quot;</p><p>The emphasis on economically measurable output is a philosophical shift in how the industry thinks about AI capability. Rather than asking whether a model can pass a bar exam or solve competition math problems \u2014 achievements that generate headlines but don&#x27;t necessarily translate to workplace productivity \u2014 the new benchmarks ask whether AI can actually do jobs.</p><h2><b>Graduate-level physics problems expose the limits of today&#x27;s most advanced AI models</b></h2><p>While <a href=\"https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/gdpval-aa\">GDPval-AA</a> measures practical productivity, another new evaluation called <a href=\"https://critpt.com/\">CritPT</a> reveals just how far AI systems remain from true scientific reasoning. The benchmark tests language models on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks across modern physics, including condensed matter, quantum physics, and astrophysics.</p><p><a href=\"https://critpt.com/\">CritPT</a> was developed by more than 50 active physics researchers from over 30 leading institutions. Its 71 composite research challenges simulate full-scale research projects at the entry level \u2014 comparable to the warm-up exercises a hands-on principal investigator might assign to junior graduate students. Every problem is hand-curated to produce a guess-resistant, machine-verifiable answer.</p><p>The results are sobering. Current state-of-the-art models remain far from reliably solving full research-scale challenges. GPT-5.2 with extended reasoning leads the <a href=\"https://critpt.com/performance-details.html\">CritPT leaderboard</a> with a score of just 11.5%, followed by Google&#x27;s Gemini 3 Pro Preview and Anthropic&#x27;s Claude 4.5 Opus Thinking variant. These scores suggest that despite remarkable progress on consumer-facing tasks, AI systems still struggle with the kind of deep reasoning required for scientific discovery.</p><h2><b>AI hallucination rates: Why the most accurate models aren&#x27;t always the most trustworthy</b></h2><p>Perhaps the most revealing new evaluation is <a href=\"https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/omniscience\">AA-Omniscience</a>, which measures factual recall and hallucination across 6,000 questions covering 42 economically relevant topics within six domains: Business, Health, Law, Software Engineering, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, and Science/Engineering/Mathematics.</p><p>The evaluation produces an <a href=\"https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/omniscience\">Omniscience Index</a> that rewards precise knowledge while penalizing hallucinated responses \u2014 providing insight into whether a model can distinguish what it knows from what it doesn&#x27;t. The findings expose an uncomfortable truth: high accuracy does not guarantee low hallucination. Models with the highest accuracy often fail to lead on the Omniscience Index because they tend to guess rather than abstain when uncertain.</p><p>Google&#x27;s <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/pro/\">Gemini 3 Pro Preview</a> leads the Omniscience Index with a score of 13, followed by Claude Opus 4.5 Thinking and Gemini 3 Flash Reasoning, both at 10. However, the breakdown between accuracy and hallucination rates reveals a more complex picture.</p><p>On raw accuracy, Google&#x27;s two models lead with scores of 54% and 51% respectively, followed by <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-5\">Claude 4.5 Opus Thinking</a> at 43%. But Google&#x27;s models also demonstrate higher hallucination rates than peer models, scoring 88% and 85%. Anthropic&#x27;s Claude 4.5 Sonnet Thinking and Claude Opus 4.5 Thinking show hallucination rates of 48% and 58% respectively, while GPT-5.1 with high reasoning effort achieves 51%\u2014the second-lowest hallucination rate tested.</p><p>Both Omniscience Accuracy and Hallucination Rate contribute 6.25% weighting each to the overall Intelligence Index v4.</p><h2><b>Inside the AI arms race: How OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic stack up under new testing</b></h2><p>The benchmark reshuffling arrives at an especially turbulent moment in the AI industry. All three leading frontier model developers have launched major new models within just a few weeks \u2014 and <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/\">Gemini 3</a> still holds the top spot on much of the leaderboards on <a href=\"https://lmarena.ai/\">LMArena</a>, a widely cited benchmarking tool used to compare LLMs.</p><p>Google&#x27;s November release of Gemini 3 prompted <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openais-altman-declares-code-red-to-improve-chatgpt-as-google-threatens-ai-lead-7faf5ea6?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdHT_hWQ_mDOX39OtUSiAMZ6k44VrIzi8_hzLcn_iE_utVD0-MtcdBRx6EXqck%3D&amp;gaa_ts=695d8989&amp;gaa_sig=q460mqQ1Jit6przj7WvyHYw-wtEWpTEY8BCjrLSqNO3C1_WL72aPE2yd1V85vZev-pz8BpH8B6sZMJlPjHnRzg%3D%3D\">OpenAI to declare a &quot;code red&quot; effort</a> to improve ChatGPT. OpenAI is counting on its GPT family of models to justify its <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/02/openai-share-sale-500-billion-valuation.html\">$500 billion valuation</a> and over <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/10/28/openai-1-trillion-altman\">$1.4 trillion in planned spending</a>. &quot;We announced this code red to really signal to the company that we want to marshal resources in one particular area,&quot; said Fidji Simo, CEO of applications at OpenAI. Altman <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/11/openai-intros-new-ai-model-gpt-5point2-says-better-at-professional-tasks.html\">told CNBC</a> he expected OpenAI to exit its code red by January.</p><p>Anthropic responded with Claude Opus 4.5 on November 24, achieving an <a href=\"https://www.swebench.com/\">SWE-Bench Verified</a> accuracy score of 80.9% \u2014 reclaiming the coding crown from both <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/gpt-5-1-codex-max/\">GPT-5.1-Codex-Max</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/\">Gemini 3</a>. The launch marked Anthropic&#x27;s third major model release in two months. Microsoft and Nvidia have since announced multi-billion-dollar investments in Anthropic, boosting its valuation to about <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/18/anthropic-ai-azure-microsoft-nvidia.html\">$350 billion</a>.</p><h2><b>How Artificial Analysis tests AI models: A look at the independent benchmarking process</b></h2><p><a href=\"https://artificialanalysis.ai/\">Artificial Analysis</a> emphasizes that all evaluations are run independently using a standardized methodology. The organization states that its &quot;methodology emphasizes fairness and real-world applicability,&quot; estimating a 95% confidence interval for the Intelligence Index of less than \u00b11% based on experiments with more than 10 repeats on certain models.</p><p>The organization&#x27;s published <a href=\"https://artificialanalysis.ai/methodology\">methodology</a> defines key terms that enterprise buyers should understand. According to the methodology documentation, Artificial Analysis considers an &quot;endpoint&quot; to be a hosted instance of a model accessible via an API \u2014 meaning a single model may have multiple endpoints across different providers. A &quot;provider&quot; is a company that hosts and provides access to one or more model endpoints or systems. Critically, Artificial Analysis distinguishes between &quot;open weights&quot; models, whose weights have been released publicly, and truly open-source models\u2014noting that many open LLMs have been released with licenses that do not meet the full definition of open-source software.</p><p>The methodology also clarifies how the organization standardizes token measurement: it uses OpenAI tokens as measured with OpenAI&#x27;s tiktoken package as a standard unit across all providers to enable fair comparisons.</p><h2><b>What the new AI Intelligence Index means for enterprise technology decisions in 2026</b></h2><p>For technical decision-makers evaluating AI systems, the <a href=\"https://artificialanalysis.ai/methodology\">Intelligence Index v4.0</a> provides a more nuanced picture of capability than previous benchmark compilations. The equal weighting across agents, coding, scientific reasoning, and general knowledge means that enterprises with specific use cases may want to examine category-specific scores rather than relying solely on the aggregate index.</p><p>The introduction of hallucination measurement as a distinct, weighted factor addresses one of the most persistent concerns in enterprise AI adoption. A model that appears highly accurate but frequently hallucinates when uncertain poses significant risks in regulated industries like healthcare, finance, and law.</p><p>The Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index is described as &quot;a text-only, English language evaluation suite.&quot; The organization benchmarks models for image inputs, speech inputs, and multilingual performance separately.</p><p>The response to the announcement has been largely positive. &quot;It is great to see the index evolving to reduce saturation and focus more on agentic performance,&quot; wrote one commenter in an <a href=\"https://x.com/ContextrixAi/status/2008585645615423881\">X.com post</a>. &quot;Including real-world tasks like GDPval-AA makes the scores much more relevant for practical use.&quot;</p><p>Others struck a more ambitious note. &quot;The new wave of models that is just about to come will leave them all behind,&quot; predicted one observer. &quot;By the end of the year the singularity will be undeniable.&quot;</p><p>But whether that prediction proves prophetic or premature, one thing is already clear: the era of judging AI by how well it answers test questions is ending. The new standard is simpler and far more consequential \u2014 can it do the work?</p>",

He wrote a 5-line Bash script that he jokingly named after Ralph Wiggum, the dim-witted but relentlessly optimistic and undeterred character from <i>The Simpsons</i>.</p><p>As Huntley explained in his initial release <a href=\"https://ghuntley.com/ralph/\">blog post</a> &quot;Ralph Wiggum as a &#x27;software engineer,&#x27;&quot; the idea relied on Context Engineering.</p><p>By piping the model\u2019s entire output\u2014failures, stack traces, and hallucinations\u2014back into its own input stream for the next iteration, Huntley created a &quot;contextual pressure cooker.&quot;</p><p>This philosophy was further dissected in a recent conversation with <a href=\"https://x.com/dexhorthy/status/2008314074015424632\">Dexter Horthy, co-founder and CEO</a> of the enterprise AI engineering firm HumanLayer, posted on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2bBWDoxO4s\">YouTube</a>.</p><div></div><p>Horthy and Huntley argue that the power of the original Ralph wasn&#x27;t just in the looping, but in its &quot;naive persistence&quot; \u2014 the unsanitized feedback, in which the LLM isn&#x27;t protected from its own mess; it is forced to confront it. </p><p>It embodies the philosophy that if you press the model hard enough against its own failures without a safety net, it will eventually &quot;dream&quot; a correct solution just to escape the loop.</p><p>By late 2025, Anthropic\u2019s Developer Relations team, led by Boris Cherny, formalized the hack into the official ralph-wiggum plugin. </p><p>However, as noted by critics in the Horthy/Huntley discussion, the official release marked a shift in philosophy\u2014a &quot;sterilization&quot; of the original chaotic concept.</p><p>While Huntley\u2019s script was about brute force, the official Anthropic plugin was designed around the principle that <b>&quot;Failures Are Data.&quot;</b> </p><p>In the official documentation, the distinction is clear. The Anthropic implementation utilizes a specialized &quot;Stop Hook&quot;\u2014a mechanism that intercepts the AI&#x27;s attempt to exit the CLI.</p><ol><li><p><b>Intercept the Exit:</b> When Claude thinks it is done, the plugin pauses execution.</p></li><li><p><b>Verify Promise:</b> It checks for a specific &quot;Completion Promise&quot; (e.g., &quot;All tests passed&quot;).</p></li><li><p><b>Feedback Injection:</b> If the promise isn&#x27;t met, the failure is formatted as a structured data object.</p></li></ol><p>The &quot;Tale of Two Ralphs&quot; offers a critical choice for modern power users:</p><ul><li><p><b>The &quot;Huntley Ralph&quot; (Bash Script/Community Forks):</b> Best for chaotic, creative exploration where you want the AI to solve problems through sheer, unbridled persistence.</p></li><li><p><b>The &quot;Official Ralph&quot; (Anthropic Plugin):</b> The standard for enterprise workflows, strictly bound by token limits and safety hooks, designed to fix broken builds reliably without the risk of an infinite hallucination loop.</p></li></ul><p>In short: Huntley proved the loop was possible; Anthropic proved it could be safe.</p><h2>What It Offers: The Night Shift for Coders</h2><p>The documentation is clear on where Ralph shines: new projects and tasks with automatic verification (like tests or linters). </p><p>But for the &quot;boring stuff,&quot; the efficiency gains are becoming the stuff of legend. According to the <a href=\"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/ralph-wiggum#ralph-wiggum-plugin\">official plugin documentation on GitHub</a>, the technique has already logged some eye-watering wins. </p><p>In one case, a developer reportedly completed a $50,000 contract for just $297 in API costs\u2014essentially arbitraging the difference between an expensive human lawyer/coder and a relentless AI loop.</p><p>The repository also highlights a Y Combinator hackathon stress test where the tool &quot;successfully generated 6 repositories overnight,&quot; effectively allowing a single developer to output a small team&#x27;s worth of boilerplate while asleep. </p><p>Meanwhile, on X, community members like <code>ynkzlk</code> have shared screenshots of Ralph handling the kind of maintenance work engineers dread, such as a 14-hour autonomous session that upgraded a stale codebase from React v16 to v19 entirely without human input.</p><p>To make this work safely, power users rely on a specific architecture. Matt Pocock, a prominent developer and educator who posted a recent<a href=\"https://youtu.be/_IK18goX4X8?si=rmcMkbv3Z0-FRZxU\"> YouTube video</a> overview of why Ralph Wiggum is so powerful.</p><p>As he states: &quot;One of the dreams of coding agents is that you can wake up in the morning to working code, that your coding agent has worked through your backlog and has just spit out a whole bunch of code for you to review and it works.&quot; </p><div></div><p>In Pocock&#x27;s view, Wiggum (the plugin) is about as close as you can come to this dream. It&#x27;s &quot;a vast improvement over any other AI coding orchestration setup I&#x27;ve ever tried and allows you to actually ship working stuff with longrunning coding agents,&quot; he states.</p><p>He advises using strong feedback loops like TypeScript and unit tests. </p><p>If the code compiles and passes tests, the AI emits the completion promise; if not, the Stop Hook forces it to try again.</p><h2>The Core Innovation: The Stop Hook</h2><p>At its heart, the Ralph Wiggum technique is deceptively simple. As Huntley put it: <i>&quot;Ralph is a Bash loop.&quot;</i></p><p>However, the official plugin implements this in a clever, technically distinct way. Instead of just running a script on the outside, the plugin installs a &quot;Stop Hook&quot; inside your Claude session.</p><ol><li><p>You give Claude a task and a &quot;completion promise&quot; (e.g., <code>&lt;promise&gt;COMPLETE&lt;/promise&gt;</code>).</p></li><li><p>Claude works on the task and tries to exit when it thinks it&#x27;s done.</p></li><li><p>The hook blocks the exit if the promise isn&#x27;t found, feeding the same prompt back into the system.</p></li><li><p>This forces a &quot;self-referential feedback loop&quot; where Claude sees its previous work, reads the error logs or git history, and tries again.</p></li></ol><p>Pocock describes this as a shift from &quot;Waterfall&quot; planning to true &quot;Agile&quot; for AI. Instead of forcing the AI to follow a brittle, multi-step plan, Ralph allows the agent to simply &quot;grab a ticket off the board,&quot; finish it, and look for the next one.</p><h2>Community Reactions: &#x27;The Closest Thing to AGI&#x27;</h2><p>The reception among the AI builder and developer community on social media has been effusive. </p><p>Dennison Bertram, CEO and founder of custom cryptocurrency and blockchain token creation platform Tally, <a href=\"https://x.com/DennisonBertram/status/2000725017617649728\">posted on X on December 15:</a> </p><blockquote><p>&quot;No joke, this might be the closest thing I&#x27;ve seen to AGI: This prompt is an absolute beast with Claude.&quot;</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://x.com/arvidkahl/status/2008202699372626091\">Arvid Kahl,</a> founder and CEO of automated podcast business intelligence extraction and brand detection tool Podscan, persuasively covered the benefits of Ralph&#x27;s persistent approach in his own X post yesterday:</p><div></div><p>And as <a href=\"https://x.com/hunterhammonds/status/2008344076773413357?s=20\">Chicago entrepreneur Hunter Hammonds put it:</a> </p><blockquote><p>Opus 4.5 + Ralph Wiggum with XcodeBuild and playwright is going to mint millionaires.\n\nMark my words.\n\nYou\u2019re not ready</p></blockquote><p>In a meta-twist characteristic of the 2025 AI scene, the &quot;Ralph&quot; phenomenon didn&#x27;t just generate code\u2014it generated a market.</p><p>And earlier this week, someone \u2014 not Huntley, <a href=\"https://x.com/GeoffreyHuntley/status/2008035818317988211\">he says </a>\u2014 launched a new <a href=\"https://phantom.com/tokens/solana/26BFDtxUpzhB6mwf93U5NiPSf878riWephC44R4Y5NNW\">$RALPH cryptocurrency token</a> on the Solana blockchain to capitalize on the hype surrounding the plugin. </p><h2>The Catch: Costs and Safety</h2><p>The excitement comes with significant caveats.
