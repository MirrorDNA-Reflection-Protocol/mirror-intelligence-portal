## Sunday Review Checklist

Every Sunday, review:

1. **Biggest correct call** — what did we get right?
2. **Most confident miss** — where were we wrong and sure?
3. **Bias correction** — any systematic errors emerging?
4. **Model calibration** — which voice was most/least accurate?

Update the Sunday Review page at `/sunday`.

## Monthly Trust Audit

On the 1st of each month:

1. Review prediction accuracy (wins/misses)
2. Audit UX clarity — is anything confusing?
3. Check user feedback (if any)
4. Update design if needed

## Quarterly Direction Review
